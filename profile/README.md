## Overview

**NexaraAI** is a next-generation artificial intelligence platform by  
**DemonZ Development**, focused on building infrastructure-grade AI systems for:

- 🧩 Intelligent Minecraft plugin ecosystems  
- 🌍 Web automation & orchestration platforms  
- ⚡ AI-assisted engineering workflows  
- 💬 A conversational AI interface inspired by Claude, Gemini & GPT *(beta)*  

NexaraAI is not a chatbot product — it is an **AI systems framework**.

---

## Model Architecture

NexaraAI is designed to operate with large-scale neural systems.

- 🧠 Target capacity: **~20 Billion parameters**  
- ⚙️ Modular multi-model orchestration layer  
- 🛰️ Proxy-based distributed inference via Cloudflare Workers  
- 🧩 Hot-swappable reasoning engines with intelligent fallback  

This enables lightweight edge deployments while retaining
enterprise-grade reasoning depth in the cloud.

## Engineering Principles

- Minimal surface area  
- Deterministic system behavior  
- Infrastructure-first architecture  
- Human-centered developer experience  

No abstraction bloat. No gimmicks. Just **systems that scale.**

---

## Repository Ecosystem

- `nexara-core` — reasoning engine & orchestration layer  
- `nexara-workers` — distributed AI proxy infrastructure
