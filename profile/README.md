## Overview

**NexaraAI** is a next-generation artificial intelligence platform developed by  
**DemonZ Development**, focused on delivering high-performance reasoning engines,
developer-first tooling, and intelligent infrastructure for:

- Minecraft plugin ecosystems  
- Web automation & orchestration platforms  
- AI-assisted engineering workflows  
- Conversational AI systems *(beta)*

NexaraAI is not a chatbot product — it is an **AI systems framework**.

---

## Model Architecture

NexaraAI is designed for operation with **large-scale neural systems**.

- 🧠 Target capacity: **~20 Billion parameters**
- ⚙️ Modular multi-model orchestration layer  
- 🛰️ Proxy-based distributed inference via Cloudflare Workers  
- 🧩 Hot-swappable reasoning engines with automatic fallback  

This architecture enables lightweight edge deployments while retaining
enterprise-grade reasoning depth in the cloud.
